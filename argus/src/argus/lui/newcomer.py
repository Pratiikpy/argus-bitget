"""The questions a newcomer asks before any research question, answered plainly.

A first-time-user audit (2026-09-30) typed "is this financial advice", "how do i buy crypto",
"can i lose more money than i put in", "should i buy the dip" and "whats a good stock for
beginners", and every one was declined with "I did not recognise that question". They are the
questions a workbench meets first from anyone new, and each has an honest answer that does not
recommend anything: what this console is, how buying on Bitget works, what can be lost, and —
where a number helps — the console's own engine run on a real example, said as the example.

The fixed text states only what is true of Bitget's public product and of this console's code. The
two answers that need a number (a dip, a first holding) hand over to the engine that computes one,
so no figure here is written by hand.
